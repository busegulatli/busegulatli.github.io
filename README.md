Hi! \
I am Buse, security researcher at Nokia Bell Labs. Before joining Nokia, I was a doctoral student at Aalto University, Department of Computer Science in Finland. <br /> 
I work in [Secure Systems Group](https://ssg.aalto.fi/) at Aalto University. <br />
My research interests include security and privacy **of** machine learning; particularly, 
1. adversarial examples,
2. model watermarking,
3. model extraction attacks and defenses

in applications of **image classification and deep reinforcement learning**. <br />
I am also interested in machine learning **for** the security and privacy including ML-based intrusion detections systems and malware detection.
